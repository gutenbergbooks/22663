    <p>
      Through the open window came the clear trill of a canary singing blithely
      in its cage. Within the tidy, homely little room a pale-faced girl and a
      youth of slender frame listened intently while the bird sang its song. The
      girl was the first to break the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim, my brother!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, dear Viola?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder does the birdie know that it is the Sabbath to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a child you are!&rdquo; answered Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that 's always the way; when you clever men can't explain a thing,
      you simply dismiss the question by calling it childish,&rdquo; Viola exclaimed,
      as though quite angry. &ldquo;And, pray, why should n't the bird know? The whole
      week it scarcely sang a note: to-day it warbles and warbles so that it
      makes my head ache. And what's the reason? Every Sabbath it's just the
      same, I notice it regularly. Shall I tell you what my idea is?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole week long the little bird looks into our room and sees nothing
      but the humdrum of work-a-day life. To-day it sees the bright rays of the
      Sabbath lamp and the white Sabbath cloth upon the table. Don't you think I
      'm right, Ephraim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, dear Viola,&rdquo; said Ephraim, and he went to the cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bird's song suddenly ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you 've spoilt its Sabbath!&rdquo; cried the girl, and she was so excited
      that the book which had been lying upon her lap fell to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim turned towards her; he looked at her solemnly, and said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pick up your prayer-book first, and then I 'll answer. A holy book should
      not be on the ground like that. Had our mother dropped her prayer-book,
      she would have kissed it.... Kiss it, Viola, my child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I 'll tell you, dear Viola, what I think is the reason why the
      bird sings so blithely to-day.... Of course, I don't say I 'm right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola's brown eyes were fixed inquiringly upon her brother's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How seriously you talk to-day,&rdquo; she said, making a feeble attempt at a
      smile. &ldquo;I was only joking. Must n't I ask if the bird knows anything about
      the Sabbath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are subjects it is sinful to joke about, and this may be one of
      them, Viola.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really quite frighten me, Ephraim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little goose, I don't want to frighten you,&rdquo; said Ephraim, while a
      faint flush suffused his features. &ldquo;I 'll tell you my opinion about the
      singing of the bird. I think, dear Viola, that our little canary knows...
      that before long it will change its quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 're surely not going to sell it or give it away?&rdquo; cried the girl, in
      great alarm; and springing to her feet, she quickly drew her brother away
      from the cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I 'm not going to sell it nor give it away,&rdquo; said Ephraim, whose
      quiet bearing contrasted strongly with his sister's excitement &ldquo;Is it
      likely that I should do anything that would give you pain? And yet, I have
      but to say one word... and I 'll wager that you will be the first to open
      the cage and say to the bird, 'Fly, fly away, birdie, fly away home!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo; cried the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola,&rdquo; said Ephraim beseechingly, &ldquo;I have taken a vow. Surely you would
      not have me break it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vow?&rdquo; asked his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola,&rdquo; Ephraim continued, as he bent his head down to the girl's face,
      &ldquo;I have vowed to myself that whenever he... our father... should return, I
      would give our little bird its freedom. It shall be free, free as he will
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is coming&mdash;he is already on his way home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola flung her arms round her brother's neck. For a long time brother and
      sister remained locked in a close embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the bird resumed its jubilant song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear how it sings again?&rdquo; said Ephraim; and he gently stroked his
      sister's hair. &ldquo;It knows that it will soon be free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A father out of jail!&rdquo; sobbed Viola, as she released herself from her
      brother's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has had his punishment, dear Viola!&rdquo; said Ephraim softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viola turned away. There was a painful silence, and then she looked up at
      her brother again. Her face was aglow, her eyes sparkled with a strange
      fire; she was trembling with agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had Ephraim seen her thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim, my brother,&rdquo; she commenced, in that measured monotone so
      peculiar to intense emotion, &ldquo;with the bird you can do as you please. You
      can set it free, or, if you like, you can wring its neck. But as for him,
      I 'll never look in his face again, from me he shall not have a word of
      welcome. He broke our mother's heart... our good, good mother; he has
      dishonored himself and us. And I can never forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it right for a child to talk like that of her own father?&rdquo; said
      Ephraim in a tremulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a child has good cause to be ashamed of her own father!&rdquo; cried
      Viola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my Viola, you must have forgotten dear mother's dying words. Don't
      you remember, as she opened her eyes for the last time, how she gathered
      up her failing strength, and raising herself in her bed, 'Children,' she
      said, 'my memory will protect you both, yea, and your father too.' Viola,
      have you forgotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had you entered that little room an hour later, a touching sight would
      have met your eyes. Viola was seated on her brother's knee, her arms round
      his neck, whilst Ephraim with the gentle love of a brother for a younger
      sister, was stroking her hair, and whispering in her ear sweet words of
      solace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bird-cage was empty.... That evening Ephraim sat up till midnight.
      Outside in the Ghetto reigned the stillness of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once Ephraim rose from his chair, walked to the old bureau which
      stood near the door, opened it, and took from it a bulky volume, which he
      laid upon the table in front of him. But he did not seem at all bent upon
      reading. He began fingering the pages, until he came upon a bundle of
      bank-notes, and these he proceeded to count, with a whispering movement of
      his lips. He had but three or four more notes still to count, when his
      sharp ear detected the sound of stealthy footsteps, in the little
      courtyard in front of the house. Closing the book, and hastily putting it
      back again in the old bureau, Ephraim sprang to the window and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, father?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim repeated his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He strained his eyes, peering into the dense darkness, but no living thing
      could he see. Then quite close to him a voice cried: &ldquo;Make no noise... and
      first put out the light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! Father, it is you then...!&rdquo; Ephraim exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; came in a whisper from without, &ldquo;first put out the light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim closed the window, and extinguished the light Then, with almost
      inaudible step, he walked out of the room into the dark passage;
      noiselessly he proceeded to unbolt the street-door. Almost at the same
      moment a heavy hand clasped his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, father!&rdquo; Ephraim cried, trying to raise his parent's hand to his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make no noise,&rdquo; the man repeated, in a somewhat commanding tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his father's hand in his, cautiously feeling his way, Ephraim led him
      into the room. In the room adjoining lay Viola, sleeping peacefully....
    </p>
    <p>
      Time was when &ldquo;Wild&rdquo; Ascher's welcome home had been far otherwise.
      Eighteen years before, upon that very threshold which he now crossed with
      halting, stealthy steps, as of a thief in the night, stood a fair and
      loving wife, holding a sturdy lad aloft in her arms, so that the father
      might at once see, as he turned the street corner, that wife and child
      were well and happy. Not another Ghetto in all Bohemia could show a
      handsomer and happier couple than Ascher and his wife. &ldquo;Wild&rdquo; Ascher was
      one of those intrepid, venturesome spirits, to whom no obstacle is so
      great that it cannot be surmounted. And the success which crowned his
      long, persistent wooing was often cited as striking testimony to his
      indomitable will. Gudule was famous throughout the Ghetto as &ldquo;the girl
      with the wonderful eyes,&rdquo; eyes&mdash;so the saying ran&mdash;into which no
      man could look and think of evil. During the earlier years of their
      married life those unfathomable brown eyes exercised on Ascher the full
      power of their fascination. A time came, however, when he alleged that
      those very eyes had been the cause of all his ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gudule's birthplace was far removed from the Ghetto, where Ascher had
      first seen the light. Her father was a wealthy farmer in a secluded
      village in Lower Bohemia. But distant though it was from the nearest town
      of any importance, the solitary grange became the centre of attraction to
      all the young swains far and near. But there was none who found favor in
      Gudule's eyes save &ldquo;Wild Ascher,&rdquo; in spite of many a friendly warning to
      beware of him. One day, just before the betrothal of the young people, an
      anonymous letter was delivered at the grange. The writer, who called
      himself an old friend, entreated the farmer to prevent his dear child from
      becoming the wife of one who was suspected of being a gambler. The farmer
      was of an easy-going, indulgent nature, shunning care and anxiety as a
      very plague. Accordingly, no sooner had he read the anonymous missive than
      he handed it to his daughter, as though its contents were no concern of
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gudule had read the letter to the end, she merely remarked: &ldquo;Father,
      this concerns me, and nobody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the matter dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until the wedding-day, half an hour before the ceremony, when the
      marriage canopy had already been erected in the courtyard, did the farmer
      sum up courage to revert to the warning of the unknown letter-writer.
      Taking his future son-in-law aside, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ascher, is it true that you gamble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; Ascher answered with equal firmness, &ldquo;Gudule's eyes will save
      me!&rdquo; Ascher had uttered no untruth when he gave his father-in-law this
      assurance. He spoke in all earnestness, for like every one else he knew
      the magnetic power of Gudule's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowhere, probably, does the grim, consuming pestilence of gaming claim
      more victims than in the Ghetto. The ravages of drink and debauchery are
      slight indeed; but the tortuous streets can show too many a humble home
      haunted by the spectres of ruin and misery which stalked across the
      threshold when the <i>first card game</i> was played.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with almost feverish anxiety that the eyes of the Ghetto were fixed
      upon the development of a character like Ascher's; they followed his every
      step with the closest attention. Long experience had taught the Ghetto
      that no gambler could be trusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though conscious that all eyes were upon him, Ascher showed himself
      most punctilious in the discharge of even the minutest of communal duties
      which devolved upon him as a denizen of the Ghetto, and his habits of life
      were almost ostentatiously regular and decorous. His business had
      prospered, and Gudule had borne him a son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gudule, my child,&rdquo; the farmer asked his daughter on the day when
      his grandson was received into the covenant of Abraham,&mdash;&ldquo;well,
      Gudule, was the letter right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What letter?&rdquo; asked Gudule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That in which your husband was called a gambler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you still give a thought to such a letter?&rdquo; was Gudule's
      significant reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years later, Gudule's father came to visit her. This time she showed
      him his second grandchild, her little Viola. He kissed the children, and
      round little Viola's neck clasped three rows of pearls, &ldquo;that the child
      may know it had a grandfather once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are your pearls, Gudule?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;those left you by your
      mother,&mdash;may she rest in peace! She always set such store by them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those, father?&rdquo; Gudule replied, turning pale; &ldquo;oh, my husband has taken
      them to a goldsmith in Prague. They require a new clasp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; remarked her father. Notwithstanding his limited powers of
      observation, it did not escape the old man's eyes that Gudule looked
      alarmingly wan and emaciated. He saw it, and it grieved his very soul. He
      said nothing however: only, when leaving, and after he had kissed the <i>Mezuza</i>*
      he said to Gudule (who, with little Viola in her arms, went with him to
      the door), in a voice quivering with suppressed emotion: &ldquo;Gudule, my
      child, the pearl necklet which I have given your little Viola has a clasp
      strong enough to last a hundred years... you need never, therefore, give
      it to your husband to have a new clasp made for it.&rdquo;
     </p>

     with the Hebrew word <i>Shadai</i> (Almighty) and with other
     texts, which is affixed to the lintel of every Jewish house.
</pre>
    <p>
      And without bestowing another glance upon his child the easy-going man
      left the house. It was his last visit. Within the year Gudule received a
      letter from her eldest brother telling her that their father was dead, and
      that she would have to keep the week of mourning for him. Ever since his
      last visit to her&mdash;her brother wrote&mdash;the old man had been
      somewhat ailing, but knowing his vigorous constitution, they had paid
      little heed to his complaints. It was only during the last few weeks that
      a marked loss of strength had been noticed. This was followed by fever and
      delirium. Whenever he was asked whether he would not like to see Gudule,
      his only answer was: &ldquo;She must not give away the clasp of little Viola's
      necklet.&rdquo; And but an hour before his death, he raised his voice, and
      loudly called for &ldquo;the letter.&rdquo; Nobody knew what letter. &ldquo;Gudule knows
      where it is,&rdquo; he said, with a gentle shake of his head. Those were the
      last words he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the old man's eyes deceived him on the occasion of his last visit to
      his son-in-law's house? No! For, setting aside the incident of the missing
      pearls, the whole Ghetto could long since have told him that the warning
      of the anonymous letter was not unfounded&mdash;for Gudule was the wife of
      a gambler.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the resistless impetuosity of a torrent released from its prison of
      ice and snow, the old invincible disease had again overwhelmed its victim.
      Gudule noticed the first signs of it when one day her husband returned
      home from one of his business journeys earlier than he had arranged.
      Gudule had not expected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not come to meet me with the children?&rdquo; he cried peevishly;
      &ldquo;do you begrudge me even that pleasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> begrudge you a pleasure?&rdquo; Gudule ventured to remark, as she
      raised her swimming eyes to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you look at me so tearfully?&rdquo; he almost shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascher loved his wife, and when he saw the effect which his rough words
      had produced, he tenderly embraced her. &ldquo;Am I not right, Gudule?&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;after a man has been working and slaving the livelong week, don't you
      think he looks forward with longing eyes for his dear children to welcome
      him at his door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Gudule felt the long latent suspicion revive in her that
      her husband was not speaking the truth. As if written in characters of
      fire, the words of that letter now came back to her memory; she knew now
      what was the fate that awaited her and her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforward, all the characteristic tokens of a gambler's life, all the
      vicissitudes which attend his unholy calling, followed close upon each
      other in grim succession. Most marked was the disturbance which his mental
      equilibrium was undergoing. Fits of gloomy despondency were succeeded,
      with alarming rapidity, by periods of tumultuous exaltation. One moment it
      would seem as though Gudule and the children were to him the living
      embodiment of all that was precious and lovable, whilst at other times he
      would regard them with sullen indifference. It soon became evident to
      Gudule that her husband's affairs were in a very bad way, for her
      housekeeping allowance no longer came to her with its wonted regularity.
      But what grieved and alarmed her most, was the fact that Ascher was openly
      neglecting every one of his religious duties. To return home late on
      Friday night, long after sunset had ushered in the Sabbath, was now a
      common practice. Once even it happened, that with his clothes covered with
      dust, he came home from one of his business tours on a Sabbath morning,
      when the people in holiday attire were wending their way to the synagogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, not a sound of complaint escaped Gudule's lips. Hers was one
      of those proud, sensitive natures, such as are to be met with among all
      classes and amid all circumstances of life, in Ghetto and in secluded
      village, no less than among the most favored ones of the earth. Had she
      not cast to the winds the well-intentioned counsel given her in that
      unsigned letter? Why then should she complain and lament, now that the
      seed had borne fruit? She shrank from alluding before her husband to the
      passion which day by day, nay, hour by hour, tightened its hold upon him.
      She would have died sooner than permit the word &ldquo;gambler&rdquo; to pass her
      lips. Besides, did not her eyes tell Ascher what she suffered? Those very
      eyes were, according to Ascher, the cause of his rapid journey along the
      road to ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you look at me so, Gudule?&rdquo; he would testily ask her, at the
      slightest provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often when, as he explained, he had had &ldquo;a specially good week,&rdquo; he would
      bring home the costliest gifts for his children. Gudule, however, made no
      use whatever of these trinkets, neither for herself nor for the children.
      She put the things away in drawers and cupboards, and never looked at
      them, more especially as she observed that, under some pretext or another,
      Ascher generally took those glittering things away again, &ldquo;in order to
      exchange them for others,&rdquo; he said: as often as not never replacing them
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gudule!&rdquo; he said one day, when he happened to be in a particularly good
      humor, &ldquo;why do you let the key remain in the door of that bureau where you
      keep so many valuables?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again Gudule regarded him with those unfathomable eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you 're... looking at me again!&rdquo; he exclaimed with sudden
      vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They 're safe enough in the cupboard,&rdquo; Gudule said, smiling, &ldquo;why should
      I lock it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gudule, do you mean to say...&rdquo; he cried, raising his hand as for a blow.
      Then he fell back in his chair, and his frame was shaken with sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gudule, my heart's love,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I am not worthy that your eyes
      should rest on me. Everywhere, wherever I go, they look at me, those
      eyes... and that is my ruin. If business is bad, your eyes ask me, 'Why
      did you mix yourself up with these things, without a thought of wife or
      children?'... Then I feel as if some evil spirit possessed me and tortured
      my soul. Oh, why can't you look at me again as you did when you were my
      bride?&mdash;then you looked so happy, so lovely! At other times I think:
      'I shall yet grasp fortune with both hands... and then I can face my
      Gudule's eyes again.' But now, now... oh, don't look at me, Gudule!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There spoke the self-reproaching voice, which sometimes burst forth
      unbidden from a suffering soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Gudule, she already knew how to appreciate this cry of her
      husband's conscience at its true value. It was not that she felt one
      moment's doubt as to its sincerity, but she knew that so far as it
      affected the future, it was a mere cry and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The years rolled on. The children were growing up. Ephraim had entered his
      fifteenth year. Viola was a little pale girl of twelve. In the opinion of
      the Ghetto they were the most extraordinary children in the world. In the
      midst of the harassing life to which her marriage with the gambler had
      brought her, Gudule so reared them that they grew to be living reflections
      of her own inmost being. People wondered when they beheld the strange
      development of &ldquo;Wild&rdquo; Ascher's children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their natures were as proud and reserved as that of their mother. They did
      not associate with the youth of the Ghetto; it seemed as though they were
      not of their kind, as though an insurmountable barrier divided them. And
      many a bitter sneer was hurled at Gudule's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she imagine,&rdquo; she often heard people whisper, &ldquo;that because her
      father was a farmer her children are princes? Let her remember that her
      husband is but a common gambler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How different would have been their thoughts had they known that the
      children were Gudule's sole comfort. What their father had never heard
      from her, she poured into their youthful souls. No tear their mother shed
      was unobserved by them; they knew when their father had lost, and when he
      had won; they knew, too, all the varying moods of his unhinged mind; and
      in this terrible school of misery they acquired an instinctive
      intelligence, which in the eyes of strangers seemed mere precocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two children, however, had early given evidence of a marked difference
      in disposition. Ephraim's nature was one of an almost feminine gentleness,
      whilst Viola was strong-willed and proudly reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said one day, &ldquo;do you think he will continue to play much
      longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola, how can you talk like that?&rdquo; Ephraim cried, greatly disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Viola impetuously flung her arms round her mother's neck, and
      for some moments she clung to her with all the strength of her passionate
      nature. It was as though in that wild embrace she would fain pour forth
      the long pent-up sorrows of her blighted childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you are so good to him. Never, never shall he have
      such kindness from me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim,&rdquo; said Gudule, &ldquo;speak to your sister. In her sinful anger, Viola
      would revenge herself upon her own father. Does it so beseem a Jewish
      child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does he treat you so cruelly, then?&rdquo; Viola almost hissed the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after fell the final crushing blow. Ascher had been away from home
      for some weeks, when one day Gudule received a letter, dated from a prison
      in the neighborhood of Vienna.
    </p>
    <p>
      In words of genuine sympathy the writer explained that Ascher had been
      unfortunate enough to forge the signature to a bill. She would not see him
      again for the next five years. God comfort her! The letter was signed: &ldquo;A
      fellow-sufferer with your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it had been with her old father, after he had bidden her a last
      farewell, so it was now with Gudule. From that moment her days were
      numbered, and although not a murmur escaped her lips, hour by hour she
      wasted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Friday evening, shortly after the seven-branched Sabbath lamp had been
      lit, Gudule, seated in her arm-chair, out of which she had not moved all
      day, called the two children to her. A bright smile hovered around her
      lips, an unwonted fire burned in her still beautiful eyes, her bosom
      heaved... in the eyes of her children she seemed strangely changed.
      &ldquo;Children,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;come and stand by me. Ephraim, you stand here on my
      right, and you, dear Viola, on my left. I would like to tell you a little
      story, such as they tell little children to soothe them to sleep. Shall
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; they both cried, as they bent towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not interrupt me, children,&rdquo; she observed, still with that
      strange smile on her lips, &ldquo;but leave me to tell my little story in my own
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, children,&rdquo; she resumed, after a brief pause. &ldquo;Every human being&mdash;be
      he ever so wicked&mdash;if he have done but a single good deed on earth,
      will, when he arrives above, in the seventh heaven, get his <i>Sechûs</i>,
      that is to say, the memory of the good he has done here below will be
      remembered and rewarded bountifully by the Almighty.&rdquo; Gudule ceased
      speaking. Suddenly a change came over her features: her breath came and
      went in labored gasps; but her brown eyes still gleamed brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In tones well-nigh inaudible she continued: &ldquo;When Jerusalem, the Holy
      City, was destroyed, the dead rose up out of their graves... the holy
      patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob... and also Moses, and Aaron his
      brother... and David the King... and prostrating themselves before God's
      throne they sobbed: 'Dost Thou not remember the deeds we have done?...
      Wouldst Thou now utterly destroy all these our children, even to the
      innocent babe at the breast?' But the Almighty was inexorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Sarah, our mother, approached the Throne... When God beheld her, He
      covered His face, and wept. 'Go,' said He, 'I cannot listen to thee.'...
      But she exclaimed... 'Dost Thou no longer remember the tears I shed before
      I gave birth to my Joseph and Benjamin... and dost Thou not remember the
      day when they buried me yonder, on the borders of the Promised Land... and
      now, must mine eyes behold the slaughter of my children, their disgrace,
      and their captivity?'... Then God cried: 'For <i>thy</i> sake will I
      remember thy children and spare them.'...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to know,&rdquo; Gudule suddenly cried, with uplifted voice,
      &ldquo;what this <i>Sechûs</i> is like? It has the form of an angel, and it
      stands near the Throne of the Almighty.... But, since the days of Rachel,
      our mother, it is the <i>Sechûs</i> of a mother that finds most favor in
      God's eyes. When a mother dies, her soul straightway soars heavenward, and
      there it takes its place amid the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Who art thou?' asks God, 'I am the <i>Sechûs</i> of a mother,' is the
      answer, 'of a mother who has left children behind her on earth.' 'Then do
      thou stand here and keep guard over them!' says God. And when it is well
      with the children, it is the <i>Sechûs</i> of a mother which has caused
      them to prosper, and when evil days befall them... it is again the Angel
      who stands before God and pleads: 'Dost Thou forget that these children no
      longer have a mother?'... and the evil is averted....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gudule's voice had sunk to a mere whisper. Her eyes closed, her head fell
      back, her breathing became slower and more labored. &ldquo;Are you still there,
      children?&rdquo; she softly whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxiously they bent over her. Then once again she opened her eyes, &ldquo;I see
      you still&rdquo;&mdash;the words came with difficulty from her blanched lips&mdash;&ldquo;you,
      Ephraim, and you, my little Viola.... I am sure my <i>Sechûs</i> will
      plead for you... for you and your father.&rdquo; They were Gudule's last words.
      When her children, whose eyes had never as yet been confronted with Death,
      called her by her name, covering her icy hands with burning kisses, their
      mother was no more....
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can tell what influence causes the downtrodden blade to raise itself
      once more! Is it the vivifying breath of the west wind, or a mysterious
      power sent forth from the bosom of Mother Earth? It was a touching sight
      to see how those two children, crushed as they were beneath the weight of
      a twofold blow, raised their heads again, and in their very desolation
      found new-born strength. And it filled the Ghetto with wonder. For what
      were they but the offspring of a gambler? Or was it the spirit of Gudule,
      their mother, that lived in them?
    </p>
    <p>
      After Gudule's death, her eldest brother, the then owner of the grange,
      came over to discuss the future of his sister's children. He wished
      Ephraim and Viola to go with him to his home in Lower Bohemia, where he
      could find them occupation. The children, however, were opposed to the
      idea. They had taken no previous counsel together, yet, upon this point,
      both were in perfect accord,&mdash;they would prefer to be left in their
      old home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When father comes back again,&rdquo; said Eph-raim, &ldquo;he must know where to find
      us. But to you, Uncle Gabriel, he would never come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The uncle then insisted that Viola at least should accompany him, for he
      had daughters at home whom she could assist in their duties in the house
      and on the farm. But the child clung to Ephraim, and with flaming eyes,
      and in a voice of proud disdain, which filled the simple farmer with
      something like terror, she cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle, you have enough to do to provide for your own daughters; don't let
      <i>me</i> be an additional burden upon you; besides, sooner would I wander
      destitute through the world than be separated from my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you propose to do then?&rdquo; exclaimed the uncle, after he had
      somewhat recovered from his astonishment at Viola's vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Uncle Gabriel,&rdquo; said Ephraim, a sudden flush overspreading his
      grief-stricken features, &ldquo;you see I have thought about it, and I have come
      to the conclusion that this is the best plan. Viola shall keep house, and
      I... I 'll start a business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> start a business?&rdquo; cried the uncle with a loud laugh. &ldquo;Perhaps
      you can tell me what price I 'll get for my oats next market day? A
      business!... and <i>what</i> business, my lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; said Ephraim, &ldquo;if I dispose of all that is left us, I shall have
      enough money to buy a small business. Others in our position have done the
      same... and then...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and then?&rdquo; the uncle cried, eagerly anticipating his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the <i>Sechûs</i> of our mother will come to our aid,&rdquo; Ephraim said
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer's eyes grew dim with moisture; his sister had been very dear to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I live!&rdquo; he cried, brushing his hand across his eyes, &ldquo;you are true
      children of my sister Gudule. That's all <i>I</i> can say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as though moved by a sudden impulse, he quickly produced, from the
      depths of his overcoat, a heavy pocketbook. &ldquo;There!&rdquo;... he cried,
      well-nigh out of breath, &ldquo;there are a hundred gulden for you, Ephraim.
      With that you can, at all events, make a start; and then you need n't sell
      the few things you still have. There... put the money away... oats have
      n't fetched any price at all to-day, 't is true; but for the sake of
      Gudule's children, I don't mind what I do... Come, put it away, Ephraim...
      and may God bless you, and make you prosper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo; cried Ephraim, as he raised the farmer's hand to his lips, &ldquo;is
      all this to be mine? All this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy, yes; it <i>is</i> a deal of money is n't it?&rdquo;... said
      Gudule's brother, accompanying his words with a sounding slap on his
      massive thigh. &ldquo;I should rather think it is. With that you can do
      something, at all events... and shall I tell you something? In Bohemia the
      oat crop is, unfortunately, very bad this season. But in Moravia it's
      splendid, and is two groats cheaper.... So there's your chance, Ephraim,
      my child; you 've got the money, buy!&rdquo; All at once a dark cloud overspread
      his smiling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a lot of money, Ephraim, that I am giving you... many a merchant
      can't lay his hands on it,&rdquo; he said, hesitatingly; &ldquo;but if... you were
      to... gam&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word remained unfinished, for upon his arm he suddenly felt a
      sensation as of a sharp, pricking needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Gabriel!&rdquo; cried Viola&mdash;for it was she who had gripped his arm&mdash;and
      the child's cheeks were flaming, whilst her lips curled with scorn, and
      her white teeth gleamed like those of a beast of prey. &ldquo;Uncle Gabriel!&rdquo;
       she almost shrieked, &ldquo;if you don't trust Ephraim, then take your money
      back again... it's only because you are our mother's brother that we
      accept it from you at all.... Ephraim shall repay you to the last
      farthing.... Ephraim doesn't gamble... you sha 'n't lose a single penny of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a shake of his head the farmer regarded the strange child. He felt
      something like annoyance rise within him; an angry word rose to the lips
      of the usually good tempered man. But it remained unsaid; he was unable to
      remove his eyes from the child's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I live,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;she has Gudule's very eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with another thumping slap on his leg, he merrily exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, we'll leave it so then.... If Ephraim does n't repay me, I 'll
      take <i>you</i>, you wild thing... for you've stood surety for your
      brother, and then I 'll take you away, and keep you with me at home. Do
      you agree... you little spit-fire, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, uncle!&rdquo; cried Viola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then give me a kiss, Viola.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child hesitated for a moment, then she laid her cheek upon her uncle's
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now I 've got you, you little spit-fire,&rdquo; he cried, kissing her again
      and again. &ldquo;Are n't you ashamed now to have snapped your uncle up like
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then after giving Ephraim some further information about the present price
      of oats, and the future prospects of the crops, with a side-shot at the
      chances of wool, skins, and other merchandise, he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was great surprise in the Ghetto when the barely fifteen-year-old
      lad made his first start in business. Many made merry over &ldquo;the great
      merchant,&rdquo; but before the year was ended, the sharp-seeing eyes of the
      Ghetto saw that Ephraim had &ldquo;a lucky hand.&rdquo; Whatever he undertook he
      followed up with a calmness and tact which often baffled the restless
      activity of many a big dealer, with all his cuteness and trickery.
      Whenever Ephraim, with his pale, sad face, made his appearance at a
      farmstead, to negotiate for the purchase of wool, or some such matter, it
      seemed as though some invisible messenger had gone before him to soften
      the hearts of the farmers. &ldquo;No one ever gets things as cheap as you do,&rdquo;
       he was assured by many a farmer's wife, who had been won by the
      unconscious eloquence of his dark eyes. No longer did people laugh at &ldquo;the
      little merchant,&rdquo; for nothing so quickly kills ridicule as success.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, two years later, his Uncle Gabriel came again to see how the
      children were getting on, Ephraim was enabled to repay, in hard cash, the
      money he had lent him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; cried Gudule's brother, with big staring eyes, as he clutched his
      legs with both hands, &ldquo;how have you managed in so short a time to save so
      much? D' ye know that that 's a great deal of money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 've had good luck, uncle,&rdquo; said Ephraim, modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 've been... playing, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words fell bluntly from the rough countryman, but hardly had they been
      uttered, when Viola sprang from her chair, as though an adder had stung
      her. &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; she cried, and a small fist hovered before Gabriel's eyes in
      such a threatening manner that he involuntarily closed them. But the
      child, whose features reminded him so strongly of his dead sister, could
      not make him angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim,&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a jocund tone, warding off Viola with his
      hands, &ldquo;you take my advice. Take this little spit-fire with you into the
      village one day... they may want a young she-wolf there.&rdquo; Then he pocketed
      the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ephraim,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;may God bless you, and grant you further luck.
      But you won't blame me if I take the money,&mdash;I can do with it, and in
      oats, as you know, there's some chance of good business just now. But I am
      glad to see that you 're so prompt at paying. Never give too much credit!
      That 's always my motto; trust means ruin, and eats up a man's business,
      as rats devour the contents of a corn-barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was but one thing that constantly threw its dark shadow across these
      two budding lives,&mdash;it was the dark figure in a distant prison. This
      it was that saddened the souls of the two children with a gloom which no
      sunshine could dispel. When on Fridays Ephraim returned, fatigued and
      weary from his work, to the home over which Viola presided with such
      pathetic housewifely care, no smile of welcome was on her face, no
      greeting on his. Ephraim, 't is true, told his sister where he had been,
      and what he had done, but in the simplest words there vibrated that tone
      of unutterable sadness which has its constant dwelling-place in such
      sorely-tried hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, a great change had come over Viola. Nature continues her
      processes of growth and development 'mid the tempests of human grief, and
      often the fiercer the storm the more beautiful the after effects. Viola
      was no longer the pale child, &ldquo;the little spit-fire,&rdquo; by whom her Uncle
      Gabriel's arm had been seized in such a violent grip. A womanly gentleness
      had come over her whole being, and already voices were heard in the <i>Ghetto</i>
      praising her grace and beauty, which surpassed even the loveliness of her
      dead mother in her happiest days. Many an admiring eye dwelt upon the
      beautiful girl, many a longing glance was cast in the direction of the
      little house, where she dwelt with her brother. But the daughter of a
      &ldquo;gambler,&rdquo; the child of a man who was undergoing imprisonment for the
      indulgence of his shameful vice! That was a picture from which many an
      admirer shrank with horror!
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Ephraim brought home a young canary for his sister. When he handed
      her the bird in its little gilt cage, her joy knew no bounds, and
      showering kisses by turns upon her brother, and on the wire-work of the
      cage, her eyes sparkling with animation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see, Ephraim, how I 'll teach the little bird to speak,&rdquo; she
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The softening influence which had, during the last few months, come over
      his sister's nature was truly a matter of wonder to Ephraim. Humbly and
      submissively she accepted the slightest suggestion on his part, as though
      it were a command. He was to her a father and mother, and never were
      parents more implicitly obeyed by a child than this brother by a sister
      but three years his junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one subject, however, upon which Ephraim found his sister
      implacable and firm&mdash;their absent father, the mere mention of whose
      name made her tremble. Then there returned that haughty curl of the lips,
      and all the other symptoms of a proud, inflexible spirit It was evident
      that Viola hated the man to whom she owed her existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus had it come about that Ephraim was almost afraid to pronounce his
      father's name. Neither did he care to allude to their mother before Viola,
      for the memory of her death was too closely bound up with that dark form
      behind the distant prison walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now return to the night on which Ephraim opened the door to his
      father. How had it come about? A thousand times Ephraim had thought about
      his father's return&mdash;and now he durst not even kindle a light, to
      look upon the long-estranged face. As silent as when he had come, Ascher
      remained during the rest of the night; he had seated himself at the
      window, and his arm was resting upon the very spot where formerly the cage
      had stood. The bird had obtained its freedom, and was, no doubt, by this
      time asleep, nestling amid the breeze-swept foliage of some wooded glen.
      <i>He</i> too had regained his liberty, but no sleep closed his eyes, and
      yet he was in safe shelter, in the house of his children.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the day began to break. The sun was still hiding behind the
      mountain-tops, but its earliest rays were already reflected upon the
      window-panes. In the <i>Ghetto</i> footsteps became audible; here and
      there the grating noise of an opening street-door was heard, while from
      round the corner resounded, ever and anon, the hammer of the watchman,
      calling the people to morning service; for it was a Fast-day, which
      commenced at sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Ascher raised himself from his chair, and quickly turned
      away from the window. Ephraim was already by his side. &ldquo;Father, dear
      father!&rdquo; he cried from the inmost depths of his heart, as he tried to
      grasp the hand of the convict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't make such a noise,&rdquo; said the latter, casting a furtive glance in
      the direction of the window, and speaking in the same mysterious whisper
      in which he had asked for admittance into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a strange awakening it was to his son, when, in the gray twilight of
      the breaking day, he looked at Ascher more closely. In his imagination
      Ephraim had pictured a wan, grief-worn figure, and now he saw before him a
      strong, well-built man, who certainly did not present the appearance of a
      person who had just emerged from the dank atmosphere of a prison! On the
      contrary, he seemed stronger and more vigorous than he had appeared in his
      best days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he had such a good time of it...?&rdquo; Ephraim felt compelled to ask
      himself... &ldquo;how different our poor mother looked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a violent effort he repressed the feelings which swelled his bosom.
      &ldquo;Dear father,&rdquo; he said, with tears in his eyes, &ldquo;make yourself quite
      comfortable; you have n't closed your eyes the whole night, you must be
      worn out. You are at home, remember... father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; said Ascher, with a deprecating gesture, &ldquo;<i>we</i>
      fellows know other ways of spending the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>We fellows!</i>&rdquo; The words cut Ephraim to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you may be taken ill, father,&rdquo; he timidly observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I taken ill! What do you take me for?&rdquo; Ascher laughed, boisterously. &ldquo;I
      have n't the slightest intention of failing ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the watchman was heard hammering at the door of the next
      house. The reverberating blows seemed to have a strangely disquieting
      effect upon the strong man; a violent tremor seized him; he cast one of
      the frightened glances which Ephraim had noticed before in the direction
      of the window, then with one bound he was at the door, and swiftly turned
      the knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, what 's the matter?&rdquo; Ephraim cried, much alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the watchman look into the room when he passes by?&rdquo; asked Ascher,
      while his eyes almost burst from their sockets, with the intent-ness of
      their gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Ephraim assured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see, wait...&rdquo; whispered Ascher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three well-known knocks now resounded upon their own door, then the
      shadow of a passing figure was thrown upon the opposite wall. With a sigh
      of relief, the words escaped Ascher's bosom:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not look inside...&rdquo; he muttered to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he removed his hand from the door-knob, came back into the centre of
      the room, and approaching the table, rested his hand upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim...&rdquo; he said after a while, in that suppressed tone which seemed
      to be peculiar to him, &ldquo;are n't you going to synagogue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father,&rdquo; replied Ephraim, &ldquo;I 'm not going to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they 'll want to know,&rdquo; Ascher observed, and at the words an ugly
      sneer curled the corners of his lip; &ldquo;they 'll want to know who your guest
      is. Why don't you go and tell them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then be good enough to draw down the blinds.... What business is it of
      theirs who your guest is? Let them attend to their own affairs.... But
      they would n't be of 'the chosen race' if they did n't want to know what
      was taking place in the furthermost corner of your brain. You can't be too
      careful with them... you 're never secure against their far-scenting noses
      and their sharp, searching eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now broad daylight. Ephraim drew down the blinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blinds are too white...&rdquo; Ascher muttered, and moving a chair forward,
      he sat down upon it with his back to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim proceeded to wind the phylacteries round his arm, and commenced to
      say his prayers softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His devotions over, he hurriedly took the phylacteries from his head and
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascher was still sitting immovable, his back to the window, his eyes fixed
      upon the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you ask me where I 've left my luggage?&rdquo; he suddenly cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'll fetch it myself if you 'll tell me where it is,&rdquo; Ephraim remarked,
      in all simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, you make me laugh,&rdquo; cried Ascher, and a laugh like that of
      delirium burst from his lips. &ldquo;All I can say, Ephraim, is, the most
      powerful giant upon earth would break his back beneath the weight of my
      luggage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then only did Ephraim grasp his father's meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry yourself, father...&rdquo; he said lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to support me, perhaps!&rdquo; Ascher shouted, with cutting
      disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim's heart almost ceased to beat. Then movements were heard in the
      adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any one with you?&rdquo; cried Ascher, springing up. His sharp ears
      had instantly caught the sounds, and again the strong man was seized with
      violent trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, it's only dear Viola,&rdquo; said Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nameless terror seemed to have over-powered Ascher. With one hand
      convulsively clenched upon the arm of the chair, and the other pressed to
      his temple, he sat breathing heavily. Ephraim observed with alarm what a
      terrible change had come over his father's features during the last few
      seconds: his face had become ashen white, his eyes had lost their lustre,
      he seemed to have aged ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and Viola entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola!&rdquo; cried Ephraim, &ldquo;here is our&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; said the girl, in a low voice, as she approached a few steps
      nearer. She extended her hand towards him, but her eyes were cast down.
      She stood still for a moment, then, with a hurried movement, turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gudule!&rdquo; cried Ascher, horror-stricken, as he fell back almost senseless
      in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it the glamour of her maiden beauty that had so overpowered this
      unhappy father? Or was it the extraordinary resemblance she bore to the
      woman who had so loved him, and whose heart he had broken? The utterance
      of her name, the terror that accompanied the exclamation, denoted the
      effect which the girl's sudden appearance had produced upon that sadly
      unhinged mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola!&rdquo; Ephraim cried, in a sorrow-stricken voice, &ldquo;why don't you come
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>can't</i>, Ephraim, I <i>can't</i>...&rdquo; she moaned, as, with halting
      steps, she walked towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, speak to him, do,&rdquo; Ephraim entreated, taking her hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; she cried, trying to release herself.... &ldquo;I am thinking of
      mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Ascher rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's my stick?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I want the stick which I brought with
      me.... Where is it? I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, you won't...&rdquo; cried Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Viola turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, with twitching lips... &ldquo;you'll want something to eat
      before you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, let me have something to eat,&rdquo; he shouted, as he brought his
      fist down upon the table. &ldquo;Bring me wine... and let it be good... I am
      thirsty enough to drink the river dry.... Wine, and beer, and anything
      else you can find, bring all here, and then, when I 've had my fill, I 'll
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, Viola,&rdquo; Ephraim whispered in his sister's ear, &ldquo;and bring him all he
      asks for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Viola had left the room, Ascher appeared to grow calmer. He sat down
      again leaning his arms upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he muttered to himself: &ldquo;I 'll taste food with my children, before
      I take up my stick and go.... They say it's lucky to have the first drink
      of the day served by one's own child... and luck I <i>will</i> have again,
      at any price... What good children! While I 've been anything but a good
      father to them, they run hither and thither and take the trouble to get me
      food and drink, and I, I 've brought them home nothing but a wooden stick.
      But I 'll repay them, so help me God, I 'll make them rich yet, but I 've
      got nothing but a wooden stick, and I want money, no play without money,
      and no luck either....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gradually a certain thoughtfulness overspread Ascher's agitated features,
      his lips were tightly compressed, deep furrows lined his forehead, while
      his eyes were fixed in a stony glare, as if upon some distant object. In
      the meantime Ephraim had remained standing almost motionless, and it was
      evident that his presence in the room had quite escaped his father's
      observation. With a chilling shudder running through his frame, his hair
      on end with horror, he listened to the strange soliloquy!... Then he saw
      his father's eyes travelling slowly in the direction of the old bureau in
      the corner, and there they remained fixed. &ldquo;Why does he leave the key in
      the door, I wonder,&rdquo; he heard him mutter between his teeth, &ldquo;just as
      Gudule used to do; I must tell him when he comes back, keys should n't be
      left in doors, never, under any circumstances.&rdquo; The entrance of Viola
      interrupted the old gambler's audible train of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim gave a gasp of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what have you brought me?&rdquo; cried Ascher, and his eyes sparkled with
      animation, as Viola produced some bottles from under her apron, and placed
      them and some glasses upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, fill up the glass,&rdquo; he shouted, in a commanding voice, &ldquo;and
      take care that you don't spill any, or you 'll spoil my luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With trembling hand Viola did as she was bidden, without spilling a single
      drop. Then he took up the glass and drained it at one draught. His face
      flushed a bright crimson: he poured himself out another glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are n't you drinking, Ephraim?&rdquo; he exclaimed, after he had finished that
      glass also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't drink to-day, father,&rdquo; Ephraim faltered, &ldquo;it's a fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fast? What fast? I have been fasting too,&rdquo; he continued, with a coarse
      laugh, &ldquo;twice a week, on bread and water; an excellent thing for the
      stomach. Fancy, a fast-day in midsummer. On such a long day, when the sun
      is up at three already, and at eight o'clock at night is still hesitating
      whether he 'll go to bed or not... what have I got to do with your
      Fast-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face grew redder every moment; he had drunk a third and a fourth
      glass, and there was nothing but a mere drain left in the bottle. Already
      his utterance was thick and incoherent, and his eyes were fast assuming
      that glassy brightness that is usually the forerunner of helpless
      intoxication. It was a sight Ephraim could not bear to see. Impelled by
      that natural, almost holy shame which prompted the son of Noah to cover
      the nakedness of his father, he motioned to his sister to leave. Then <i>he</i>,
      too, softly walked out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, in the corridor, the brother and sister fell into each other's
      arms. Both wept bitterly: for a long time neither of them could find words
      in which to express the grief which filled their souls. At length Viola,
      her head resting upon Ephraim's shoulder, whispered: &ldquo;Ephraim, what do you
      think of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is ill, I think...&rdquo; said Ephraim, in a voice choked with sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you call <i>that</i> illness, Ephraim?&rdquo; Viola cried; &ldquo;if that's
      illness, then a wild beast is ill too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola, for Heaven's sake, be quiet: he 's our own father after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim!&rdquo; said the girl, with a violent outburst of emotion, as she again
      threw herself into her brother's arms... &ldquo;just think if mother had lived
      to see this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't, don't, Viola, my sweet!&rdquo; Ephraim exclaimed, sobbing convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim!&rdquo; the girl cried, shaking her head in wild despair, &ldquo;I don't
      believe in the <i>Sechûs!</i> When we live to see all this, and our hearts
      do not break, we lose faith in everything.... Ephraim, what is to become
      of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, dear Viola, hush, you don't know what you are saying,&rdquo; replied
      Ephraim, &ldquo;I believe in it, because mother herself told us... you must
      believe in it too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Viola again shook her head. &ldquo;I don't believe in it any longer,&rdquo; she
      moaned, &ldquo;I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noiselessly, Ephraim walked toward the door of the front room; he placed
      his ear against the keyhole, and listened. Within all was silent. A fresh
      terror seized him. Why was no sound to be heard?... He opened the door
      cautiously lest it should creak. There sat his father asleep in the
      arm-chair, his head bent on his bosom, his arms hanging limp by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Viola,&rdquo; he whispered, closing the door as cautiously as he had
      opened it, &ldquo;he is asleep....I think it will do him good. Be careful that
      you make no noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola had seated herself upon a block of wood outside the kitchen door,
      and was sobbing silently. In the meantime, Ephraim, unable to find a word
      of solace for his sister, went and stood at the street door, so that no
      unbidden guest should come to disturb his father's slumbers. It was
      mid-day; from the church hard by streamed the peasants and their wives in
      their Sunday attire, and many bestowed a friendly smile upon the
      well-known youth. But he could only nod his head in return, his heart was
      sore oppressed, and a smile at such a moment seemed to him nothing short
      of sin. He went back into the house, and listened at the door of the room.
      Silence still reigned unbroken, and with noiseless steps he again walked
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is still sleeping,&rdquo; he whispered to his sister. &ldquo;Just think what would
      have happened if we had still had that bird.... He would n't have been
      able to sleep a wink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim, why do you remind me of it?&rdquo; cried Viola with a fresh outburst
      of tears. &ldquo;Where is the little bird now, I wonder?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim sat down beside his sister, and took her hand in his. Thus they
      remained seated for some time, unable to find a word of comfort for each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length movements were heard. Ephraim sprang to his feet and once more
      approached the door to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is awake!&rdquo; he softly said to Viola, and slowly opening the door, he
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascher was walking up and down with heavy tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel refreshed after your sleep, father?&rdquo; Ephraim asked timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascher stood still, and confronted his son. His face was still very
      flushed, but his eyes had lost their glassy stare; his glance was clear
      and steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim, my son,&rdquo; he began, in a kindly, almost cheerful tone, &ldquo;you 've
      grown into a splendid business man, as good a business man as one can meet
      with between this and Vienna. I 'm sure of it. But I must give you one bit
      of advice; it 's worth a hundred pounds to one in your position. Never
      leave a key in the lock of a bureau!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim looked at his father as though stupefied. Was the man mad or
      delirious to talk in such a strain? At that moment, from the extreme end
      of the <i>Ghetto</i>, there sounded the three knocks, summoning the people
      to evening prayer. As in the morning, so again now the sound seemed to
      stun the vigorous man. His face blanched and assumed an expression of
      terror; he trembled from head to foot. Then again he cast a frightened
      glance in the direction of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but knocking, knocking!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;They would like to knock
      the most hidden thoughts out of one's brains, if they only could. What
      makes them do it, I should like to know?... To the clanging of a bell you
      can, at all events, shut your ears, you need only place your hands to
      them... but with that hammer they bang at every confounded door, and drive
      one crazy. Who gives them the right to do it, I should like to know?&rdquo; He
      stood still listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he will be long before he reaches here?&rdquo; he asked Ephraim,
      in a frightened voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has already knocked next door but one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another minute, and the three strokes sounded on the door of the house.
      Ascher heaved a sigh of relief; he rubbed his hand across his forehead; it
      was wet with perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he cried, as though addressing himself, &ldquo;that 's over, and
      won't come again till to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim, my son!&rdquo; he cried, with a sudden outburst of cheerfulness,
      accompanying the words with a thundering bang upon the table, &ldquo;Ephraim, my
      son, you shall soon see what sort of a father you have. Now, you 're
      continually worrying your brains, walking your feet off, trying to get a
      skin, or praying some fool of a peasant to be good enough to sell you a
      bit of wool. Ephraim, my son, all that shall soon be changed, take my word
      for it. I 'll make you rich, and as for Viola, I 'll get her a husband&mdash;such
      a husband that all the girls in Bohemia will turn green and yellow with
      envy.... Ascher's daughter shall have as rich a dowry as the daughter of a
      Rothschild.... But there 's one thing, and one thing only, that I need,
      and then all will happen as I promise, in one night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that, father!&rdquo; asked Ephraim, with a slight shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luck, luck, Ephraim, my son!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;What is a man without luck?
      Put a man who has no luck in a chest full of gold; cover him with gold
      from head to foot; when he crawls out of it, and you search his pockets,
      you 'll find the gold has turned to copper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you have luck, father?&rdquo; asked Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim, my son!&rdquo; said the old gambler, With a cunning smile, &ldquo;I 'll tell
      you something. There are persons whose whole powers are devoted to one
      object&mdash;how to win a fortune; in the same way as there are some who
      study to become doctors, and the like, so these study what we call luck...
      and from them I 've learned it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He checked himself in sudden alarm lest he might have said too much, and
      looked searchingly at his son. A pure soul shone through Ephraim's open
      countenance, and showed his father that his real meaning had not been
      grasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he shouted loudly, waving his arms in the air, &ldquo;what is to
      come no man can stop. Give me something to drink, Ephraim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; the latter faltered, &ldquo;don't you think it will harm you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be a fool, Ephraim!&rdquo; cried Ascher, &ldquo;you don't know my constitution.
      Besides, did n't you say that to-day was a fast, when it is forbidden to
      eat anything? And have I asked you for any food? But as for drink, that's
      quite another thing! The birds of the air can't do without it, much less
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim saw that for that evening, at all events, it would not do to
      oppose his father. He walked into the kitchen where Viola was preparing
      supper, or rather breakfast, for after the fast this was the first meal of
      the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;make haste and fetch some fresh wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For him?&rdquo; cried Viola, pointing her finger almost threateningly in the
      direction of the sitting-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't, don't, Viola!&rdquo; Ephraim implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are fasting!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not also fasting for him?&rdquo; said Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a full bottle in his hand Ephraim once more entered the room. He
      placed the wine upon the table, where the glasses from which Ascher had
      drunk in the morning were still standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Viola?&rdquo; asked Ascher, who was again pacing the room with firm
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is busy cooking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her she shall have a husband, and a dowry that will make half the
      girls in Bohemia turn green and yellow with envy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he approached the table, and drank three brimming glasses, one after
      the other. &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; he said, as with his whole weight he dropped into
      the old arm-chair.... &ldquo;Now I 'll have a good night's rest. I need strength
      and sharp eyes, and they are things which only sleep can give. Ephraim, my
      son,&rdquo; he continued after a while in thick, halting accents... &ldquo;tell the
      watch&mdash;Simon is his name, I think&mdash;he can give six knocks
      instead of three upon the door, in the morning, he won't disturb me... and
      to Viola you can say I 'll find her a husband, handsomer than her eyes
      have ever beheld, and tell her on her wedding-day she shall wear pearls
      round her neck like those of a queen&mdash;no, no, like those of Gudule,
      her mother.&rdquo; A few moments later he was sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the dead of night. All round reigned stillness and peace, the peace
      of night! What a gentle sound those words convey, a sound akin only to the
      word <i>home!</i> Fraught, like it, with sweetest balm, a fragrant flower
      from long-lost paradise. Thou art at rest, Ascher, and in safe shelter;
      the breathing of thy children is so restful, so tranquil....
    </p>
    <p>
      Desist! desist! 'T is too late. Side by side with the peace of night,
      there dwell Spirits of Evil, the never-resting, vagrant, home-destroying
      guests, who enter unbidden into the human soul! Hark, the rustling of
      their raven-hued plumage! They take wing, they fly aloft; 't is the shriek
      of the vulture, swooping down upon the guileless dove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there no eye to watch thee? Doth not thine own kin see thy foul deeds?
    </p>
    <p>
      Desist!
    </p>
    <p>
      'T is too late....
    </p>
    <p>
      Open is the window, no grating noise has accompanied the unbolting of the
      shutter.... The evil spirits have taken care that the faintest sound shall
      die away... even the rough iron obeys their voices... it is they who have
      bidden: &ldquo;Be silent; betray him not; he is one of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even the key in the door of the old bureau is turned lightly and without
      noise. Groping fingers are searching for a bulky volume. Have they found
      it? Is there none there to cry in a voice of thunder: &ldquo;Cursed be the
      father who stretches forth his desecrating hand towards the things that
      are his children's&rdquo;?...
    </p>
    <p>
      They <i>have</i> found it, the greedy fingers! and now, but a spring
      through the open window, and out into the night....
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a sudden ray of light shines through a crack in the door of
      the room.... Swiftly the door opens, a girlish figure appears on the
      threshold, a lighted lamp in her hand. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gudule!&rdquo; he shrieks, horror-stricken, and falls senseless at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascher was saved. The terrible blow which had struck him down had not
      crushed the life from him. He was awakened. But when, after four weeks of
      gruesome fever and delirium, his mind had somewhat regained its
      equilibrium, his hair had turned white as snow, and his children beheld an
      old, decrepit man.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which Viola had denied her father when he returned to them in all the
      vigor of his manhood, she now lavished upon him in his suffering and
      helplessness, with that concentrated power of love, the source of which is
      not human, but Divine. In the space of one night of terror, the merest bud
      of yesterday had suddenly blossomed forth into a flower of rarest beauty.
      Never did gentler hands cool a fever-heated brow, never did sweeter voice
      mingle its melody with the gruesome dreams of delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his sick-bed, lovingly tended by Ephraim and Viola, an ennobling
      influence gradually came over the heart of the old gambler, and so deeply
      touched it, that calm peace crowned his closing days. It was strange that
      the events of that memorable night, and the vicissitudes that had preceded
      it, had left no recollection behind, and his children took good care not
      to re-awaken, by the slightest hint, his sleeping memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      A carriage drew up one day in front of Ascher's house. There has evidently
      been a splendid crop of oats this year. Uncle Gabriel has come. Uncle
      Gabriel has only lately assumed the additional character of father-in-law
      to Ephraim, for he declared that none but Eph-raim should be his pet
      daughter's husband. And now he has come for the purpose of having a
      confidential chat with Viola. There he sits, the kind-hearted,
      simple-minded man, every line of his honest face eloquent with good-humor
      and happiness, still guilty of an occasional violent onslaught upon his
      thighs. Viola still remains his &ldquo;little spit-fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Viola, my little spit-fire,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;won't you yet allow me to
      talk to my Nathan about you? Upon my word, the boy can't bear the suspense
      any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; says Viola, and a crimson blush dyes her pale cheeks: &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo;
       she repeats, in a tone of such deep earnestness, that the laughing
      expression upon Gabriel's face instantly vanishes, &ldquo;please don't talk to
      him at all. My place is with my father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And to all appearances Viola will keep her word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she taken upon herself a voluntary penance for having, in her heart's
      bitter despair, presumed to abjure her faith in the <i>Sechûs</i> of her
      mother? Or was there yet another reason? The heart of woman is a strangely
      sensitive thing. It loves not to build its happiness upon the hidden ruins
      of another's life.
